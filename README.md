# Machine-Learning-for-Texts
Sprint 14 â€“ Machine Learning for Texts  Project Summary: Trained a sentiment analysis model using IMDB data, demonstrating the ability to extract and analyze sentiments from textual data. Technical Skills: Natural Language Processing (NLP), sentiment analysis, text preprocessing, and machine learning applied to textual data.

## Project Description
The Film Junky Union, a new edgy community for classic movie enthusiasts, is developing a system for filtering and categorizing movie reviews. The goal is to train a model to automatically detect negative reviews. I'll be using a dataset of IMBD movie reviews with polarity labelling to build a model for classifying positive and negative reviews. It will need to have an F1 score of at least 0.85.

## Conclusion
Although I was able to get a score above 0.85 on all models, the highest f1 score I found on the NLTK & TF-IDF datasets was using the Linear Regression model. Due to the similar results, we can conclude that the results aren't as dependent on the models as it is on the results of the vectorization methods.
